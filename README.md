### Source Code

```
SaveSetting "Folder Name", "Sub-Folder Name" , "Key Name" , "Key Value"
' Writes to the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER,VB AND VBA PROGRAM SETTINGS. (then your folder) This is good for keeping track of runtimes, user settings, ect..
GetSetting "Folder Name", "Sub-Folder Name", "Key"
' Retrives the value of the KEY specified in the code. So, if KEY's value was 5, then it would return a value of 5.
